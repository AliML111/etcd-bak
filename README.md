# etcd-bak
With this bash script you will have the needed commands for etcd's backup and, restore processes.

You will be given three commands. One to backup and, the other two to restore from your backup with specifying ther data directory or without it.

All you have to do is passing two arguments when you are excuting the script. One for the path-to-backup-file and, the other for data-directory.
